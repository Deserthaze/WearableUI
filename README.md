WerableUI is an Android Framework, developed in 2016, to aid programmers in designing and implementing innovative see-through UIs for wearable devices, such as the Epson Moverio. The framework also provides functionalities to connect a Myo to the device on which the UI is being displayed and use it to move a cursor on the virtual Canvas and interact with its components through simple hands gestures.
